# InsuranceApp
Developed a user interface that a client will see when they select a type insurance in the checkout of their purchase. This interface is to calculate the cost of phone insurance considering condition, brand, and year of the phone. The interface calculates a quote for the user and allows the user to email themselves the information to get their quoted price.
